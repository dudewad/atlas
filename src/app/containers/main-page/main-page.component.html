    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made
      to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My
      joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you
      going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much
      easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get
      technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just
      about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you
      nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for
      help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

    Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them
    off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't
    you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I
    didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into
    the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care
    what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl!
    Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!
